# Real Estate Price Prediction 🌟🏠

Welcome to the Real Estate Price Prediction project! This application uses machine learning and modern web technologies to predict home prices based on various input features. Whether you're a real estate enthusiast or just curious about property pricing, this project showcases a comprehensive approach to building and deploying predictive models.

## Project Overview 🚀

This project is divided into three main components:

1. **Machine Learning Model 🔍**
   - Built using **Scikit-Learn** with **Linear Regression**.
   - Trained on the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle.
   - Covers essential data science concepts:
     - Data loading and cleaning
     - Outlier detection and removal
     - Feature engineering
     - Dimensionality reduction
     - GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
     - K-Fold Cross-Validation

2. **Python Flask Server 🌐**
   - A RESTful API server built with **Flask**.
   - Serves HTTP requests to make predictions using the trained model.
   - Handles data input and provides price predictions.

3. **ReactJS Frontend 🎨**
   - A user-friendly web interface built with **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS**.
   - Allows users to enter home details like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
   - Connects to the Flask server to retrieve and display predicted home prices.

## Technologies & Tools 🛠️

- **Python** for model building and backend development
- **Numpy** and **Pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning and model evaluation
- **Jupyter Notebook**, **Visual Studio Code**, and **PyCharm** as IDEs
- **Flask** for creating the HTTP server
- **ReactJS** and **Tailwind CSS** for building the web UI
